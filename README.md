# notes

## First Session

- Introduction to the Java boilerplate
- Basic use of classes and objects and datatypes 
- Highlight the importance of test our code 
- Enum method example 
- Git & GitHub basics 
- Use Markdown notes

### Suggested lectures:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter
* https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

## Second Session
- Fork databasic project from github.com/kinbiko repo and clone locally
- Write the databasic requirements
- Write databasic design
- Initializate Java IntellyJ IDEA project into the cloned directory and commit changes

### Notes:
- In desing we just put the strategy to follow not implentation details. Design is very important, even Software engineers are 
for problem solving so if a problem arise we have to make more design (before to go to code).

- For design we have to consider what kind of operation we are going to be using into our main Java method: 
Insert and Query

- Use 'git push -f' command (usualy needed after use git commit -m 'xyz' --amend) carefully because this overwrite the commit 
so non 'reset' or 'revert' will work. This means thereis loose data risk.

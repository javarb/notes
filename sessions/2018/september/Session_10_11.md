## Session 10 and 11 (04/09/2018, 10/09/2018)

- TDD challenge solved
- Coverage Tests

### Notes:

#### TDD challenge Session 9 was solved

The challenge of [counting houses positions][1] proposed at Session 9 was completed using TDD.

During Session 10, Roger showed me an example of how to do this program in order I have resolved it for the Session 11. I solved it based in what I saw and during Session 11 he reviewed my work making corrections and suggestions as necessary.

Concept of Coverage Tests was introduced, meaning the percentaje of our code that our test are covering.
At practice this is not much manageable to have a 100% of coverage, since this is not always possible to cover
all possible test conditions. For example in database consults where the test are out of scope of Java Code
and pass into the DBMS level. Also, tests can be heavy because the load of make hundreds of tests cases can produce. So this has to be manageable in a convenient way.

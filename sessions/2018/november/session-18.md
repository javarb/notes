# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN JAVA

## Session 18 (27/11/2018)

- Reviewing homework
- Adding BugSnag to my API code
- Partial Git commits

### Notes

#### Reviewing my Homework

Roger was reviewing my homework and made me several suggestions that has to be addressed:

- If I go to <http://localhost:8080/api/factorial/30>, I receive the result `265252859812191058636308480000000`. But If use the frontend this is rounding the result to `2.6525285981219107e+32`. So this must also show the numbers with the same precision as in the backend.

- Verify numbers are being showed as numbers and not as strings.

Also he talk to me about source maps see [here][2] and [here][3] to minimize included JS or CSS files in order to the web application loads faster.

#### Adding BugSnag to my API code

To add BugSnag to my code I had to follow the options described in their oficial repositories to [integrate with Java][1]. Then create an account into their website. I did under my particular name (also worked as my company name). After that, I had to create a new project specifying the programming language for which they provided to me the instructions to complete and test the integration.

Basically the configurations are the following:

At the controller, I injected the BugSnag class and throwed a test exception:

```java
public class CalculatorController {

    private final Calculator calculator;
    private final Bugsnag bugsnag;

    public CalculatorController(Calculator calculator, Bugsnag bugsnag) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
        this.bugsnag = bugsnag;
    }

    @GetMapping("/fibonacci/{number}")
    public List<BigInteger> getFibonacci(@PathVariable("number") Integer number){
      bugsnag.notify(new RuntimeException("Test error"));
      return calculator.getFibonacci(number);
    }
...
}
```

And I just copied the BugsnagConfig class code snippet into my IDE and the class was automatically created.  

After this was done, running my application and testing that map, I could to visit my BugSnag desktop and see the exception being catched at:

 <https://app.bugsnag.com/javier-arboleda/learning-api/errors>

Any other exceptions are being collected automatically by the BugSnag class and sent to their API. So it isn't needed to make additional configurations.


#### Adding BugSnag to my calculator-frontend code (homework)

In order to integrate BugSnag to my frontend application I've created a new javascript project and followed the provided CDN instructions:

1. Include Bugsnag via a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` of your HTML:

  ```html
  <script   src="//d2wy8f7a9ursnm.cloudfront.net/v5/bugsnag.min.js"></script>
  <script>window.bugsnagClient = bugsnag('c1c57249d048d65eda12a54354e6e33b')</script>
  ```

  Itâ€™s best to initialize Bugsnag before any other JavaScript so it can catch as many errors as possible.

  **NOTE:** Notice the `src="//` in the script tag isn't specifying the protocol, this works however a webserver be loading the application (practically this is 100% of time) but just if I am running the single page from my filesystem in the browser this will not work. For solve it I had to run a simple web server and this works as expected (see tip below).

2. To verify that your integration is working, call `notify()` in your application:

  ```js
  bugsnagClient.notify(new Error('Test error'))
  ```

And the error appears in the dashboard after refresh the window.

[Here][4] documentation about how to integrate BugSnag when using sourcemaps.



#### Making partial git commits

When I want to add to a specific commit just a part of the code that I have modified, the following command can be used:

$ git add -p

And this will be asking for confirmation to add specific chunks of code (I can split in more chunks if I want)

Example:

```git
$ git add -p
diff --git a/build.gradle b/build.gradle
index ad5c980..87c18ed 100644

I have to verify also if there is something else to add that has not been added:

```bash
[jaar@port-staff api]$ git status
On branch bugsnag-integration
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   build.gradle
        modified:   src/main/java/co/org/osso/api/CalculatorController.java

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        src/main/java/co/org/osso/api/BugsnagConfig.java

[jaar@port-staff api]$ git add .
```

#### Debugging example

Instead to be printing lot of messages to console its more useful and flexible to debug the code, this is done adding breakpoints (red circles) to the code and once the application is stopped, it can be debbuged clicking on the bug icon or mouse right click menu and 'Debug Application'.  

When the application is being debugged, the value of the variables can be saw in all moment and steps can be traced over the program execution. Also, through the mouse right click menu the option Evaluate Expression can be used to evaluate and get the ouput of the desired expression in any moment. For example: `fibonacci.size()` to obtain the size of the `List` called fibonacci.

### Homework

- [x] Make a new branch and pull request (knowing there's not commits) for reviewing purposes of my Frontend application.

  **NOTE:** For this I created the branch and pushed with the upstream option so this copied all the current master branch content, and from there I did the normal PR.

- [x] Integrate BugSnag into my Frontend application (see section above)
- [ ] Address comments to my frontend code.

### Tips

- **GitHub Tip:** When making a commit one can write the message in the default system editor by running `git commit` without `-m` flag. An example of a good commit message is [here][5]

- To start a simple web server to test the application, we can run one with phyton as specify [here][6]. If have Python 3 (as my case), so run with `python -m http.server` and go to http://localhost:8000/ (or the specified port)
